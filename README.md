Introduction
The datasets that data professionals use to solve problems typically contain missing values, which must be dealt with in order to achieve clean, useful data.
This is particularly crucial in exploratory data analysis (EDA). In this problem, I am showing how I address missing data.

Objective
I will be analyzing lightning strike data obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spanning the years 1987 to 2020 for my project document. To manage the extensive dataset, which consists of millions of rows, I’ve undertaken preprocessing to streamline the information, retaining only the year and the corresponding count of lightning strikes.

The primary objective of my project is to explore the variation in total lightning strike counts for each year and pinpoint any outliers within the dataset.

Tools used: Python, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

Method Used
Boxplot visual tool to effectively analyze data distribtuion by percentiles and quartiles.
Using IQR method for Outlier Detection
Plot scatterplot to visualise the outliers in red
Understanding outliers impact on the mean and median

### Seoul Bike Rental Maintenance 2018

![image](https://github.com/Lawrence-le/portfolio/assets/151991077/6cb5dc5d-c264-4804-8459-fc97d4084cca)

Scenario

In my current project as a data professional consulting for the Seoul transportation department, I'm tasked with analyzing the rented bicycle data from 2018. The director of the department has specifically requested insights into the best time of day for maintenance teams to repair bikes. The goal is to schedule maintenance during lower traffic times while adhering to standard working hours (8 a.m. to 5 p.m).

To achieve this, I am utilizing Tableau to design a data visualization that effectively illustrates the low-traffic periods on standard workdays. The visualization will be instrumental in identifying optimal time slots for bike maintenance. Importantly, the director has specified the inclusion of gradients of orange to align with the company colors.

In the process of designing the visualization, my primary focus is on clarity, accessibility, and ethical considerations. The visualization should provide a clear representation of low-traffic times during standard work hours. I will use Tableau's features to filter and present the data in a visually appealing manner, making it accessible to stakeholders.

Additionally, I also created another visual that divide the bike rental by season to show what are the best low peak time of the day during different seasons to carry out maintenance.
